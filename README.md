# 🔁 Asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) – Verilog Project

## 📘 Overview

This project implements an **asynchronous FIFO** memory buffer using Verilog. It enables data transfer between two clock domains — a common requirement in digital systems such as SoCs, communication interfaces, and multi-clock data pipelines.


## 🚀 Features

- Dual Clock Support (Write and Read are asynchronous)
- Independent Write and Read Pointers
- Dual-Port RAM for simultaneous access
- Full and Empty condition detection
- Basic testbench for simulation (Vivado-compatible)
